## Hosting Dynamic Sites Here Are Like Dreams

One problem I just realize, is that GitHub Pages is a static site host!  
The only way to showcase my little work is by the HTML iframe.  
Better than noting tho :D  
<iframe width="900" height="750" src="https://shiny.rcg.sfu.ca/u/youyangf/MyApp/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Side Note
There are plenty of things I can improve.  
Notice that I only pulled the Vancouver average Snow and Temperature measures from the database.  
I can make a drop-down menu for user to choose a specific Province/City, then use `grep` to filter a sub data frame for that.  
Also, user should be able to switch to some other databases of their choices, like the Canada Min/Max Temperature database.  
I will be updating this Shiny App, if I have time...
